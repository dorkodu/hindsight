# Hindsight

## What?

Hindsight is a Markdown based static website generator. <br>Hindsight makes creating, deploying and maintaining static websites easier.

## Why?

Because I wanted to have an automated way for creating static websites.<br>It became hard to develop and maintain documentation websites. Using a CMS was just overkill.<br>So I said, what changes on templates among websites? **Settings and Content.**<br>Everything is automated, run Hindsight and get your website content.

### What we need for generating a static website :

- a configuration file for website information (**JSON**)
- contents of pages (**Markdown**)
- a single template file (**HTML + CSS**)

## How?

Simple. Create a folder for your website project.<br>Run Hindsight in that folder from terminal.

> ### NOTE
>
> Hindsight is built using PHP. It is a PHAR binary.<br>So using **PHP CLI** is recommended, but you can also use a LAMP stack to run it.
